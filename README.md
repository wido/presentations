# Presentations
This repository contains presentations I give on conferences and meet-ups.

Most of them are about Ceph, CloudStack or IPv6 but other topics might be covered.

Presentations are all in RST format and can be compiled to PDF using rst2pdf.

## Building
Run the *build.sh* script in the directory of a presentation to build it.

Or you can run the *build-all.sh* script to build all presentations at once.

<pre>
$ ./build-all.sh
</pre>
