# Presentations
This repository contains presentations I give on conferences and meet-ups.

Most of them are about Ceph, CloudStack or IPv6 but other topics might be covered.

Presentations are all in RST and can be compiled to a PDF using rst2pdf.

Run the build.sh script in the directory to do that.
